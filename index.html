          <p>Tyranids were first described in Rick Priestley's Rogue Trader, the first edition of the Warhammer 40,000. At that time they were not an emphasized race in the game, instead representing a limited number of occasionally encountered alien antagonists. Their physical appearance was not imposing or especially horrific: they were depicted as six limbed, relatively diminutive creatures (an appearance which would later be assigned to Tyranid genestealers). In later iterations of Warhammer 40,000-related products (starting with the release of Advanced Space Crusade) the Tyranids were given a complete makeover and became a major race, popularized by a number of successful expansions.</p>

          <p>Unlike most Warhammer 40,000 races, the Tyranids do not have a direct Warhammer Fantasy Battle counterpart, but share a horde mentality with the Skaven and Lizardmen armies. This, along with the extensive use of larger, stronger creatures and primal defense mechanisms leads to the widely-drawn inference that the Tyranids are the closest Warhammer 40,000 counterpart to the Lizardmen in terms of how they play.</p>
          <p>Tyranids often form a fast-moving close-combat army that relies on overwhelming its enemies through waves and waves of mostly small but deadly creatures, while larger creatures provide a source of powerful attacks. They may also rely heavily on ranged combat, if different selections are made, or field an impressive but small array of monstrous titans rather than a typical swarm. Tyranid armies are therefore able to bring a varied threat to bear on their opponents.</p>
